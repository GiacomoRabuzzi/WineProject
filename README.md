# WineProject
Our analysis aims to identify which of the different data mining classification techniques is best able to model taste preferences for white wine, based on analytical data that is easily accessible during the certification phase of any wine. The K-NN model trained on a classe-balanced dataset provides positive results, outperforming all the other models tested.
This work can be useful in determining which products can be considered of excellence, in terms of taste preferences, based on specific physicochemical characteristics.
